# GPC (general purpose console)
Console shell for fun.
1) Download all C++ header and source files manually or git clone the repository: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository.
2) Issue "g++ sgard.cpp consolemanager.cpp trie.cpp trienode.cpp -o commandline" in the directory with the files.
3) Run the app: "./commandline".
4) Use "help" or "?" to get a scanty list of commands.
5) Try them :)
This is a working draft.
