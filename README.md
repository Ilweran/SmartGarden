# SmartGarden
Application for controlling different environmental parameters over a garden area.
1) Download all C++ header and source files manually or git clone the repository: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository.
2) Issue "g++ sgard.cpp humidity.h humidity.cpp inputhandler.h inputhandler.cpp -o smartgarden" in the directory with the files.
3) Run the app: "./smartgarden".
4) Use "help" or "?" to get a scanty list of commands.
5) Try them :)
This is a working draft without any real sensors in the garden. One may feel free to add IoT devices so that to create a really smart garden. I myself will do this later.
